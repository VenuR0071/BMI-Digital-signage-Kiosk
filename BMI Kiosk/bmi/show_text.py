a= """1. Choose healthy carbohydrates such as whole grain cereal 🌽🌽, bread🍞, brown rice 🌾, or beans 🥜 at each meal or snack. Try to limit sugary 🍰🥮 and highly processed foods 🍦.

2. Add good fats including nuts 🥜 and seeds 🥑, olive and canola oil🌻🌻, and avocado 🥑 to snacks, meals and recipes whenever possible.

3. Don't fill up on vegetables 🥕🥦🥬 at meals as they may prevent you from eating more energy-dense foods. Cooking vegetables in olive oil or 🌻healthy oil-based sauces can help increase the calorie density of vegetables servings. Fruits are also filled with nutrients and have more calories so if you get full easily, eat more fruits than vegetables. Dried fruits are even more calorie dense, so try to include them in meals and snacks throughout the day.

4. Make sure to add resistance training to your 🏃‍ 🏋 🚴exercise regimen so you gain muscle in addition to body fat. This may help increase your appetite too.

5. If you find that water🥛 fills you up, limit consumption at meals. Try drinking 100 percent juice 🥤 or 1 percent milk with meals and drink water between meals.
